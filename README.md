### Part 1 - PCB
Python3 to implemented a PCBQueue with doubly linked list. It used a class with pid, priority, state, jobtime property as the PCB data structure. For the adding, deleting, and inspecting I use a simply loop over the linked list as the algorithm in this my very initial demo version. Here is my PCB part code and screenshot in current phase version, and it may be changed in my final project report.
